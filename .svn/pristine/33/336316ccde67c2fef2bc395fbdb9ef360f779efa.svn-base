  <h3>Usage of Connction, ObjectStore and UserConext</h3>To get a authorized
  object store to CE server, Java system properties must be set. Then the
  following code can be used to get a authorized object store.
  <pre>
        /*
         * 1. get connection
         */
        // ceUrl is Content Engine URL
        Connection conn = Factory.Connection.getConnection(ceUrl); // 

        /*
         * 2. push subject for a user
         */
        Subject subject = UserContext.createSubject(conn,
                                                    username, // a user's name
                                                    password, // a user's password
                                                    null);
        UserContext uc = UserContext.get();
        uc.pushSubject(subject);

        /* 
         * 3. fetch object store
         */
        Domain domain = Factory.Domain.getInstance(conn, null);
        ObjectStore os = Factory.ObjectStore.fetchInstance(domain, osName, null);
  
</pre>A authorized object store can reused in the same thread as the execution
of the above code. There are 2 ways if authorized store with same authorization
information (same user and password) needs to be used in different threads.

  <ul>
    <li>execute the above to create a authorized object store with the same
    authorized information</li>

    <li>reuse the object store and push the subject into the current thread's
    UserConext</li>
  </ul>Method 1 has a bad performance because Step 1 and Step 3 involves
  round-trips to CE server. For Method 2, reuse of a authorized object store
  only involves push a subject which is saved when creating the authorized
  object store. It has a much better performance than Method 1. Some
  performance tests have been done for these 2 methods. The result shows the
  performance analysis is right. For 1000 times of getting a authorized object
  store, Method 1 cost 70 seconds. But Method 2 only costs 3 seconds.
