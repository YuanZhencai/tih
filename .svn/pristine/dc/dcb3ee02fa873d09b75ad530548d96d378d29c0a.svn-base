<body>
Helper classes for PE API.

<p>For <tt>throws VWException</tt> in all the methods, there is no
Javadoc comment for it or simply no <tt>@throws VWException</tt>. The
reason is that almost all PE API methods throw <tt>VWException</tt>.
<p>This package is brought from the PE helpers created by IBM RISE
team.
